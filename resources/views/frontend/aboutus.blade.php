   			<hr>
   			<h4 class="text-justify">Our proposed project is Poverty Alleviation Organization that will help men and women through loan donations. Since our project is agro-centric and handicraft based, our working platform will be agriculture, handicraft and the people involved in the work. <br>
			 Our system will be operated by an owner who will be indirectly involved with the project through the loan and will be able to monitor the entire transaction but will not be able to make any edit in case of money transaction. <br>
			 The owner will be able to preserve all information of his employees and edit all information of the employees. <br>
			 Employees will mainly deal with farmers and handicraft artists. Because they will investigate and loan all information to farmers and handicraft artists. <br>
			 When farmers and handicraft artists come to pay their loan money in installments, employees will keep an account and store it in a database that they will use later. <br>
			 Another opportunity for handicraft artists is to sell their products online. <br>
			 Customers who want to buy goods online must register. <br>
